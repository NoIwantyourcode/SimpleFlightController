Hi!,

Welcome to my simple filght controller repository

This is a flight controller as the name suggests that is specifically designed to pilot remote controlled aircraft and provides accurate data to make flying your plane easier!,
some features I plan for to be included in the firmware are
       - 3 axis stabilization
       - altitude management

This is not a comprehensize list of features I may include and the actual firmware may have a lot more


Here are a few images of the Flight controller Schematics, PCB view and Rendered PCB view

Please kindly note that no firmware exists due to the fact that I haven't been able to fabricate the device yet, However I will add firmware after I recieve the device and given suffiecient time to program it
