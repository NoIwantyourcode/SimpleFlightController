Hi!,

Welcome to my simple filght controller repository

This is a flight controller as the name suggests that is specifically designed to pilot remote controlled aircraft and provides accurate data to make flying your plane easier!,
some features I plan for to be included in the firmware are
       - 3 axis stabilization
       - altitude management

This is not a comprehensize list of features I may include and the actual firmware may have a lot more


Here are a few images of the Flight controller Schematics, PCB view and Rendered PCB view

NOTES TO REVIEWER:

In the bom.csv file it says that I am using a ICM-45686 Inertial Measurement Unit however, due to part shortfalls at JLCPCB, I have to substitute the ICM-45686 with ICM-45605 as it is another, more availible model

The additional cost in my grant is due to initial setup prices and fees due to the use of PCBA
Here is a screenshot of the additional fees
